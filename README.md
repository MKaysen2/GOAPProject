All credit for the original GOAP system goes to J. Orkin (Monolith Productions, 2004)

This project is a personal attempt to implement the "Goal Oriented Action Planning"
system in Unreal Engine. I am using this project to improve my C++ skills,
my familiarity with UE4, and also to gain more concrete experience with game related
AI concepts.
